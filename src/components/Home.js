      <p>I call Seattle, Washington, home -- but in the past I've been able to call my home California, Colorado, Paris, and Osaka.</p>
      <p className="bold">What are you hoping to work in after DBC?</p>
      <p>I'd like to pursue a career in Front End or Full Stack development :)</p>
      <p className="bold">What are your top 5 yet to be traveled to destinations?</p>
      <p>Norway, Iceland, Greece, Italy, Sweden.</p>
        <p>I've been drawn towards are my whole life.  As a child I'd spend hours thinking up the perfect design or idea and through high school I took extra classes after school at another campus so that I could learn to silkscreen.  When I finally got to college I abandoned anything artistic as a possible pathway to make a living.  A few years back I found myself being pulled back towards what I really loved because website design seemed not only a possible career, but got me excited about art again.  I like to pay attention to the small details in design and can't wait to put my touches on more sites.</p>
